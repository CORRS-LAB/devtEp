# TODO

1. This project aims to identify cell type specific DNA methylation regions associated with phenotypes using RRBS data.
   To derive a robust estimation of immune cell fractions, we first perform a benchmarking study to compare 19 deconvolution algorithms using RRBS data.
   Four key steps are included in this project: marker selection, benchmarking of deconvolution algorithms, estimating the immune cell fractions from real RRBS data, identifing cell type specific DNA methylation regions associated with phenotypes.

2. Immune Cell Type Specific DNA Methylation Regions associate with phenotypes
   
3. HELP Manual:
    - explain the data structure with simple example(s) 
    - explain the return value
    - explain the usage
    - if possibel, illustrate the way to prepare data (<discuss> we should link it to another repository to tackle this?</discuss>)
