1. This project aims to identify cell type specific DNA methylation regions associated with phenotypes using RRBS data.
   To derive a robust estimation of immune cell fractions, we first perform a benchmarking study to compare 19 deconvolution algorithms using RRBS data.
   Four key steps are included in this project: marker selection, benchmarking of deconvolution algorithms, estimating the immune cell fractions from real RRBS data, identifing cell type specific DNA methylation regions associated with phenotypes.
