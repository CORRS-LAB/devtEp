1. This project aims to identify cell type specific DNA methylation regions associated with phenotypes using RRBS data.
   To derive a robust estimation of immune cell fractions, we first perform a benchmarking study to compare 19 deconvolution algorithms using RRBS data.
   Three key steps are included in this project: benchmarking of deconvolution algorithms, estimating the immune cell fractions from real RRBS data, identifing cell type specific DNA methylation regions associated with phenotypes.

    - explain the data structure with simple example(s) 
    - explain the return value
    - explain the usage
    - if possibel, illustrate the way to prepare data (<discuss> we should link it to another repository to tackle this?</discuss>)
